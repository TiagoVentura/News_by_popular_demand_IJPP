Replication materials for "News by Popular Demand: Ideology, Issue Attention, and Media Reputation in News Sharing" by Natalia Aruguete,  Ernesto Calvo and Tiago Ventura. The article is forthcoming at the International Journal of Press/Politics


> __Abstract:__
Social media news sharing has become a central subject of scholarly research in communication studies. To test current theories, it is of the utmost importance to estimate meaningful parameters of news sharing behavior from observational data. In this article, we retrieve measures of cognitive congruence (ideology), issue salience (attention), and media prevalence (reputation) to explain news sharing in social media. We exemplify the usefulness of the model with an analysis of the relationship between ideology and issue attention. We test the performance of the model using data from Brazil, Argentina, and the US.
